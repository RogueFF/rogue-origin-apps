Build a Real-Time Production Command Center.

Create an agent team with 3 teammates:
1. Frontend designer - Load frontend-design skill, create premium UI (NOT generic dashboard aesthetics)
2. Backend engineer - API integration, real-time polling, data management
3. QA tester - Testing, verification, documentation

Requirements:
- Poll API: https://rogue-origin-api.roguefamilyfarms.workers.dev/api/production?action=scoreboard
- Features: real-time metrics, crew rate monitoring, target tracking, predictive finish time, bag timer alerts, crew breakdown
- Deliverables:
  * src/pages/command-center-v2.html
  * src/css/command-center-v2.css
  * src/js/command-center-v2/main.js
- Use DIFFERENT filenames (v2) to preserve original for comparison
- Integrate into dashboard nav as 'Command Center v2'
- Commit and push when complete

The bar: production-ready, directly comparable to the single-agent version.
