## 2026-01-13: Timer Freeze Bug Fix

**Issue**: Bag timer counting backwards/incrementing during lunch breaks instead of freezing

**Root Cause**:
- When `debugOnBreak=true`, code in `timer.js:81` was skipping ALL scheduled break subtractions
- This caused elapsed time calculation to include break time that should be excluded
- Result: Timer appeared to increment during breaks

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed condition `if (!State || State.debugOnBreak !== true)` that was skipping break subtraction
- Changed to always subtract scheduled breaks, regardless of debug mode
- Debug break mode now only freezes `endTime` at break start, doesn't skip historical break calculations

**Files Modified**:
- `timer.js:79-100` - Always subtract completed breaks
- `state.js:368-380` - `testBreakMode()` helper function for testing

**Testing**:
```javascript
// Browser console command to test break freeze
testBreakMode(true);  // Freezes timer, turns yellow
testBreakMode(false); // Resumes timer
```

**Verification**:
- Diagnostic test confirms timer freezes correctly (39:50 → 39:50 over 6 seconds)
- Break start timestamp is cached and doesn't change during break
- Timer resumes normally when break ends

**Status**: ✅ Deployed and verified working
