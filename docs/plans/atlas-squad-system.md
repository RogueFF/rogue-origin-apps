# Atlas Squad System — Master Plan

_Created: 2026-02-12 | Status: DRAFT | Author: Atlas + Koa_

---

## The Vision

Koa has one life. He works too much. He loves his job but it eats his bandwidth for everything else — trading, travel, Nicole, health, building wealth outside of RO.

**The Atlas Squad is a team of AI agents that compresses Koa's work, grows his wealth, and creates space for the life he wants.** Not a fancy to-do list. Not a chatbot collection. A coordinated intelligence network that thinks, acts, and delivers — across every domain of his life.

**The end state:** Koa wakes up, checks Mission Control on his wide Envy screen with coffee. He sees:
- Pre-market brief with today's plays and market conditions
- RO production status and anything that needs his attention
- Travel deals Nicole would love
- Side hustle opportunities worth exploring
- His portfolio performance and open positions
- Agent activity feed showing what got done overnight

He makes decisions. The agents execute. He goes to work with clarity, not chaos. After work, he and Nicole review trading ideas together, plan their next trip, and build toward freedom.

**North Star Metrics:**
- Hours saved per week at RO (target: 10+)
- Trading portfolio growth (starting $3K)
- Days traveled per year (current: ? → target: set with Koa)
- Side income streams launched

---

## The Three Domains

### 1. WORK — Rogue Origin Optimization

**Goal:** Compress Koa's RO workload. Better data, less manual tracking, smarter delegation.

**Current pain points:**
- Production tracking is manual/whiteboard-heavy
- Agronomy (plant health, water, soil, pests) is mostly gut feel
- War room tasks are verbal, not tracked
- Consignment intake/payouts require Koa's direct involvement
- Web apps are constantly changing and breaking

**Agents:**

#### Friday — Dev Agent
- Owns rogue-origin-apps codebase
- Gets assigned implementation tasks, writes code, runs tests, pushes commits
- Uses Claude Code CLI + Agent Teams
- Available 24/7 for bug fixes and feature work
- **Frees Koa from:** spending half his day coding/debugging the apps

#### Radar — Operations Analyst
- Monitors production data in real-time during shifts
- Tracks hour-by-hour output, cycle times, pace vs. target
- Flags anomalies before they become problems
- Compiles daily/weekly production reports automatically
- Learns seasonal patterns over time
- **Frees Koa from:** manually pulling and analyzing production numbers

#### Dispatch — Task & Project Manager
- Owns Mission Control task board
- Digitizes war room output — tasks assigned in meeting get tracked
- Sends reminders, flags overdue items
- Tracks who's doing what across the 20-person crew
- **Frees Koa from:** keeping task status in his head

#### Grower — Agronomy Agent (seasonal, grow season)
- Tracks planting schedules, seed/cultivar decisions, acre allocations
- Monitors weather data for the fields
- Logs plant health observations (pest, nutrient, water notes)
- Builds historical data so good seasons can be replicated
- Compares current conditions to past seasons
- Eventually: integrates soil sensors, drone imagery, satellite data
- **Frees Koa from:** being the only person who knows the grow history

### 2. TRADING — Financial Intelligence

**Goal:** Build a research and intelligence operation around Koa's $3K starting bankroll. Surface opportunities, track performance, learn together.

**Koa's profile:**
- Trading since 2018, experienced with options, momentum, long-term plays
- Loves risk, loves rumors, loves learning
- Robinhood for stocks/options, Aster for crypto leverage
- NOT building an auto-trader — building a research desk that makes him faster and smarter
- Nicole wants to learn — this needs to be accessible to a beginner too

**Agents:**

#### Viper — Market Intelligence
- Scans Reddit daily (r/wallstreetbets, r/options, r/daytrading, r/stocks, r/cryptocurrency) using free .json endpoints
- Filters signal from noise — sentiment spikes, unusual DD, momentum plays
- Tracks unusual options activity via free data sources
- Scores opportunities by risk level (conservative → degen)
- Morning pre-market summary delivered to Mission Control + Atlas Survey
- **What Koa gets:** "Here's what Reddit is buzzing about, here's what's actually worth looking at, here's what's garbage"

#### Wire — News & Catalyst Tracker
- Monitors earnings calendars, FDA decisions, FOMC dates, SEC filings, crypto regulatory news
- Catches breaking news that moves tickers
- Connects dots across sectors ("Company X got a contract, their supplier Y hasn't moved")
- During market hours: real-time alerts to Atlas Survey app for breaking catalysts
- **What Koa gets:** "NVDA earnings after close today, implied move is 8%, here's the options play if you want exposure"

#### Regime — Market Health Monitor
- Tracks overall market conditions daily
- Distribution day counts, breadth indicators, VIX levels, sector rotation
- Clear signal: "conditions favor buying" vs. "sit in cash" vs. "high risk, small positions only"
- Updated pre-market and mid-day
- **What Koa gets:** A traffic light for the market. Green/yellow/red. No guessing.

#### Ledger — Portfolio & Performance Tracker
- Tracks all positions (stocks, options, crypto)
- Logs entry thesis, exit thesis, outcome
- Calculates win rate, average gain/loss, best setups
- Weekly performance review
- Tracks what the agents recommended vs. what actually happened (agent accuracy scoring)
- **What Koa gets:** "You're up 12% this month. Your best plays were momentum breakouts. Your worst were earnings gambles. Here's what that means."

#### Nicole's View
- Not a separate agent — a filtered view of the trading domain
- Simplified explanations of what the agents found
- "Learn with me" mode: each alert includes a 2-sentence explainer of WHY this matters
- Gradually increases complexity as she learns
- **What Nicole gets:** A way into this world that doesn't feel overwhelming

### 3. LIFE — Personal Freedom

**Goal:** Create space for travel, health, side income, and the things that matter outside of work.

**Agents:**

#### Scout — Opportunity Finder
- Scans for side hustle opportunities matching Koa + Nicole's profile
- Looks at: online businesses, micro-SaaS, dropshipping, content, consulting, local opportunities
- Factors in: can be done remotely, scales without time, leverages existing skills (data, agriculture, tech)
- Delivers brief + pros/cons + startup cost + estimated time investment
- Not a firehose — 1-2 vetted opportunities per week max
- **What Koa gets:** "Found a niche opportunity in [X]. Here's the thesis. Here's what it would take."

#### Guide — Travel & Life Planner
- Tracks flight deals from Medford/Portland to destinations Koa + Nicole want
- Plans trips around RO's seasonal calendar (slower periods = travel windows)
- Handles logistics research — hotels, activities, budgets
- **What Koa gets:** "There's a $280 RT to Hawaii from Portland in March. RO is between seasons. Window is open."

#### Sensei — Goals & Accountability
- Tracks personal goals Koa sets (fitness, financial milestones, learning targets)
- Weekly check-ins, not daily nagging
- Connects goals to actions: "To hit your travel goal, your trading account needs to reach $X by Y date"
- **What Koa gets:** The big picture view of whether he's moving toward freedom or just staying busy

## Agent Architecture

### Identity System
Each agent lives in `tools/agents/<name>/`:
```
tools/agents/
├── friday/
│   ├── AGENT.md        # Role, personality, rules, capabilities
│   ├── memory.md       # Persistent memory between invocations
│   └── current-task.md # What it's working on right now
├── radar/
├── viper/
├── wire/
├── regime/
├── ledger/
├── scout/
├── guide/
├── sensei/
├── dispatch/
└── grower/
```

### Communication Flow
```
Koa ←→ Atlas (Telegram / Mission Control)
            ↓
        Atlas delegates to agents
            ↓
    ┌───────┼───────┐
    ↓       ↓       ↓
  Friday  Viper   Radar  ... (specialist agents)
    ↓       ↓       ↓
  Results flow back to Atlas
            ↓
        Atlas synthesizes + delivers to Koa
            ↓
    Mission Control updated in real-time
```

### How Agents Run
- **Atlas** = always-on orchestrator (OpenClaw main session, Opus)
- **Specialist agents** = spawned on demand via `sessions_spawn` or Claude Code CLI
- **Scheduled work** = cron jobs trigger Atlas, Atlas delegates to the right agent
- **Persistent memory** = each agent reads/writes its own memory file between invocations
- **Shared state** = Mission Control database is the single source of truth

### Agent Tiers (cost optimization)
- **Opus** — Atlas only (orchestration, synthesis, complex reasoning)
- **Sonnet** — Friday, Radar, Regime, Ledger (coding, analysis, moderate complexity)
- **Haiku** — Viper, Wire, Scout, Guide, Dispatch (scanning, filtering, simple tasks)
- **Local Ollama** — heartbeat checks, simple parsing, state management (free)

## RO Compression — Detailed Design

### War Room Digitization
- After each Gemba walk, Koa (or anyone) speaks or types tasks into Mission Control
- Dispatch assigns them, sets deadlines, tracks completion
- War room gets a tablet or screen showing the task board
- No more "did that get done?" — it's tracked

### Agronomy Data Platform
- Grower agent maintains a structured log:
  - Daily observations (weather, plant condition, water levels)
  - Pest/disease incidents with photos
  - Soil test results
  - Seed/cultivar performance by field and year
  - Harvest yields per acre per strain
- Over time, this becomes RO's institutional knowledge
- "What did we do differently in 2024 when Lifter yielded 20% more?"

### Production Auto-Reporting
- Radar already has API access to production data
- Automated daily report to Jacob + Koa: output, pace, anomalies
- Hour-by-hour charts generated and pushed to Mission Control
- No one has to ask "how are we doing?" — it's always visible

### Consignment Automation
- Already partially built (intake handler)
- Extend: auto-inventory tracking, auto-payout calculation, vendor payment history
- Vendor dashboard in Mission Control showing balances

---

## Side Hustle Framework

### What Scout Looks For
- **Remote-friendly** — can be done from anywhere
- **Scalable** — doesn't trade more time for more money
- **Leverages existing skills** — Koa's data/tech/agriculture/operations background
- **Low startup cost** — under $1K to test
- **AI-advantaged** — something where having Atlas + agents creates an unfair advantage

### Categories to Explore
1. **Micro-SaaS** — small software tool solving a niche problem (Koa can build, Atlas can help)
2. **Content/Education** — hemp industry knowledge, farming tech, AI operations (YouTube, courses)
3. **Consulting** — help other hemp/cannabis operations with data/process optimization
4. **E-commerce** — dropshipping or niche product (Nicole could co-run)
5. **Trading as income** — once the system is proven, it becomes a side income stream itself
6. **AI agent services** — literally sell what we're building to other businesses

Scout delivers 1-2 opportunities per week. Koa and Nicole review together. If something clicks, we build a plan and execute.

## Principles

1. **Research tool, not auto-anything.** Koa makes the calls. Agents surface information and execute tasks. No agent spends money or makes trades without explicit approval.
2. **Nicole is a first-class user.** Everything we build should be accessible to her, not just Koa.
3. **Data compounds.** Every observation logged, every trade tracked, every season recorded. The system gets smarter over time because the data gets richer.
4. **Start cheap, prove value, then invest.** The first version costs $11/mo extra. We earn the right to spend more by delivering results.
5. **Freedom is the metric.** If something doesn't move toward more time, more money, or more options — it doesn't get built.

---

## Open Questions
- What destinations are on Koa + Nicole's travel wishlist?
- Does RO have existing soil/weather data from past seasons?
- What crypto projects/tokens is Koa currently interested in?
- What time does Koa typically check his phone first thing in the morning? (for brief timing)
- Does Nicole have her own phone/device she'd use for Mission Control?
