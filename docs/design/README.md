# Design Specifications

This folder contains detailed design specifications created by **Claude Opus** for implementation by **Claude Sonnet 4.5**.

## Workflow

1. **Opus creates** → Detailed design specs (this folder)
2. **Sonnet implements** → Production code (index.html)

## Expected Files

These files should be created by Opus during the design phase:

- [ ] `VISUAL_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` - Colors, typography, spacing, shadows, animations
- [ ] `COMPONENT_SPECS.md` - Hero section, widgets, cards, charts, buttons
- [ ] `ICON_SET.md` - Custom botanical icon specifications (20+ icons)
- [ ] `ANIMATION_SYSTEM.md` - Page load, interactions, transitions, timing
- [ ] `MOBILE_DESIGN.md` - Breakpoints, gestures, mobile layouts

## Status

**Current Phase**: Awaiting Opus design work

**Next Steps**:
1. Switch to Opus model
2. Read `DESIGN_HANDOFF.md`
3. Create the 5 design specification files above
4. Switch back to Sonnet for implementation
